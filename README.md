## EddieG's 5etools converted homebrew content.

This is the working repo for all homebrew content. It is a nested repo in the forked Homebrew repo, to make work on various files easier.

In the future, there will likely be a script made to inject content here into the Homebrew repo, to reduce the hassle of working with two repositories.
